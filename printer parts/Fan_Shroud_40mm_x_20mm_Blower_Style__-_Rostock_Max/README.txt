# Summary

I recently been trying the all-metal effector by [713Maker](http://713maker.com/effector.html) (basic kit with 38mm spacers and standard lock ring) which required me to revert back to stock fan shrouds.  I had to figure a way to improve the cooling compared to the [previous](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1284511) effector. Rather than continue propping a desk fan on some of those pesky PLA prints, I opted to increase the size of the fans from stock (for V2) 30x10mm blower fans to heftier 40x20mm blower fans (BPB4020M12).

I'm really happy with the results so far enough to publish and share.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: SeeMeCNC
Printer: Rostock MAX
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Yes
Resolution: .20mm
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
I used Proto-Pasta's [Carbon Fiber](https://www.seemecnc.com/collections/filament/products/proto-pasta-carbon-fiber-1-75mm-pla-3d-printer-filament-5kg-spool).  I designed it so there's minimal amounts of support - I had S3D create support from build platform then I tweaked it a little - not really any internally was necessary by design. The fans fit snug enough it doesn't require glue or weight in screws.

# Updates

Don't use Proto-Pasta's Carbon Fiber unless you avoid higher temp plastics (i.e. ABS) that don't use cooling fans.  The peek fan blows the hot air over one of the shrouds and it will begin to soften, droop and eventually collide with the print.

Do'h!

Since I needed to reprint some shrouds, I tweaked the model smoothing nearly everything on the inside for flow and I thickened the center exit braces to insure a decent result.

The reprints use [SeeMeCNC Midnight Black ABS](https://www.seemecnc.com/collections/filament/products/1-75-mm-black-abs-filament-2-spool).

I even vapor washed them for improved airflow and to make them **purdy**.

I didn't have rubber bands on the other shrouds, but decided to put some on just in case. For whatever reason I felt I need to fasten the fans down this time for a piece of mind.  I've only had a fan pop off once on the old shrouds so I tacked them down with a little bit of silicone.  Unnecessary now with rubber bands.
