# Summary

A fully 3D-printable rotating stand for filament spools, designed to be easily made without the need for fasteners such as screws, nuts, shafts, glue, etc. Every single component in this spool holder comes right from your 3D printer's filament.  
The spool holder's spindle is shaped to fit the vast majority of commonly used filament spools with shaft holes ranging from 16 mm to 62 mm in diameter. It is also compatible with spool-less filament coils.  
The spindle which holds the spool's weight rotates on its own roller wheels, which makes it turn effortlessly.   
The spool holder included an arm for filament guide tubes of both common sizes 1.75 mm and 3.0 mm. The arm also contains a pocket for inserting a piece of sponge which acts a a filament filter - thus keeping the filament clean and lubricated.  
#####FEATURES  
- Easy to 3D print  
- Needs no glue or fasteners  
- All parts can be 3D-printed  
- Fits almost any filament spool size  
- Has built-in filament filter!  
- Can also hold spool-less filament coils  
- Base versions available for standing on flat surfaces or fit on extruded aluminium profiles.  
Next time you need a new filament spool holder, just 3D-print one! :)

####3D-print only what you need while testing!  

As you already realise this image is not the entire filament spool stand (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:508896). It shows a crucial part and best-practice related to 3D-printing.  

As with any product development one never knows exactly from start how things will fit together.  

Depending on what 3D printer and settings you use, this spool stand will take a few hours to print. It is therefore unnecessary to 3D-print lengthy product iterations just to find out that you need to change a portion of the whole design.  

The 3D-prints shown in this image represent the parts of the model with fittings which we wanted to give a test-run before we defined the final dimensions.   

Therefore we cut away the smallest possible volume surrounding the fittings and 3D-printed them in a fraction of the time which otherwise would have taken hours and hours to find out.  

After measuring the results we could adjust the CAD-model correspondently and get perfect fittings when 3D-printing the final model.  

This procedure is perfect for testing overhangs, fittings, crucial dimensions, material consumption cost, etc.  

So in other words.... don't waste time and filament! :)
