# Summary

<h3>CAS</h3>

Like many of you I also have a lot of the great xyz cubes lying around. What do you do with it? My idea was CAS my xyz-cube cargo ship. Since I have, as already written, many cubes, I still had the idea of a modular transport ship. Get everything in one package. 

Have fun trying it out.

<h3>Important</h3>
Unfortunately, it is not always easy to get a perfect fit for all printers, so I decided on a middle way. If the segments have too much play, it is best to stick some tesa/adhesive tape over the connectors. So the game should be easy to fix. I demonstrated it in the video at the end.


Even if my boats are not benchmarks (benchy), you can use them for quality control.

<h3>Support me :)</h3>

Although it is a lot of fun to draw boats and bring them to life, it takes a lot of time to research and draw. Especially the 1:1000 scale models are very time-consuming.
So I wanted to see if there are any dear enthusiasts among you who appreciate my work and support me a little bit. 
Thank you for your help :)
