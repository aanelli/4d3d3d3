# Summary

The PolyPearl Tower is Polymaker's new model designed to test your 3D printer and filament to their limits! The popular 3D Benchy model has become the go to print for users looking to optimize their printers and software settings. However, with the development in filaments and printers over the last couple years, the Benchy model only serves as an entry level when pushing your printer to the limits. Most printers PLA settings will produce a solid Benchy, which is why we have created the much more challenging PolyPearl Tower. With inspiration drawn from the famous Oriental Pearl Tower located down the road from Polymaker's Headquarters in Shanghai, this is an architectural model.... with a twist.
