# Summary

<br><br>
So I love how many of us love the original benchy. The only thing I've always found a little pity it can't swim. 

Since I have drawn a few ships so far, I just wanted to try to draw a small, floating benchmark boat. Of course, it's not seaworthy. I also wanted to stay very close to the printing time of the original.

<br><br>

Some of them I took over, others I replaced. If you want to test it yourself and of course I am happy about your results.

<i><strong>What I have to add to this, BEN swims only very barely but I was able to keep the print time close to the benchy.</strong></i>

<h3>Support me :)</h3>
<p>
Although it is a lot of fun to draw boats and bring them to life, it takes a lot of time to research and draw. Especially the 1:1000 scale models are very time-consuming.
So I wanted to see if there are any dear enthusiasts among you who appreciate my work and support me a little bit. 
Thank you for your help :)
