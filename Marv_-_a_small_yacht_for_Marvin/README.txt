# Summary

<h3>Playtime with MARV</h3>

Like many of you, I have a lot of Marvins lurking around. My son also likes to play with the little ones. So why not connect one to the other. MARV offers 5 small Marvins place to go on discovery tour. This time I left out fragile details to achieve a better stability for the smaller children. Nevertheless, always be careful that the ships do not belong in your mouth. So have fun printing now.


Even if my boats are not benchmarks (benchy), you can use them for quality control.

<h3>Support me :)</h3>
<p>
Although it is a lot of fun to draw boats and bring them to life, it takes a lot of time to research and draw. Especially the 1:1000 scale models are very time-consuming.
So I wanted to see if there are any dear enthusiasts among you who appreciate my work and support me a little bit. 
Thank you for your help :)
