# Summary

I really like the model of [Another Dice Tower V2](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3127957) but like many others I struggled to find a suitable bottle. So this is my attempt at an alternative.

Instead of a bottle I created a 3D printable wall that fits the original model. While you loose the transparency (even when printed with transparent PETG like I did) It imho matches the look of the tower quite nicely. I also added a few windows so there is a minimum amount of "see through". Since the wall is thicker than a regular bottle would be I also had to create a custom crown to make it fit. Even though I tried a non-transparent version I like the transparent one better. It looks kind of cool and it's a lot brighter inside.

It should be printable without support or brim/raft (worked well for me at least).

**Please note:** This model is scaled to fit [Another Dice Tower V2](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3127957) if you want to use it for [Another dice tower](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2839354) you will have to scale it down. After breaking the top part due to incredibly thin walls I reprinted the V2 version from *Another dice tower* by scaling it up to 103.4%. Since this seems to have worked the correct factor to scale this model down should be roughly 96.71%. I have not tested this though - if you do please let me know if it worked.
