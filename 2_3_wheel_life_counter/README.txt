# Summary

Improved version of my life counter. Added feet, possibility of having two or three wheels and notches to the wheels so they don't get rotated by accident. Also cleaned the model somewhat. Added thinner wheel if you have issues with fit.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: i3 MK3
Rafts: No
Supports: Yes
Resolution: .2
Infill: 10%

Notes: 
No supports needed except for the inner notch bottom in the wheel, might work without.

This was designed with tighter tolerances and as such there are few solutions if you have issues:
1) When screw is screwed to the bottom, feet are not quite equal.
   Solution: Print the Loose version of the model which has screw turned back slightly
2) The wheels don't fit in the space between the ends.
   Solution: Scale the wheels to be slightly thinner in the slicer.

I hit the second on as my Z-calibration was screwed and the wheels ended up being 12.25mm thick.
