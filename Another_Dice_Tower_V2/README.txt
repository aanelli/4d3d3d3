# Summary

The original thing seems to have been recently deleted, re-upping for posterity.

Original description:

"Clear plastic comes from a 1.5L Smart Water bottle from wal-mart.
https://www.walmart.com/ip/smartwater-nutrient-enhanced-water-Bottle-1-5-Liter/15673702

Treasure is from multiple casts of the Wiz Kids treasure sculpts.

Cut the Smart water bottle to 7 inches. Best using a table saw with a sled and stop block to ensure accuracy and square edge.

Took the sticker off with Goo Gone, but that left a fogging of the plastic. Used some Crest toothpaste on the area, and buffed it with my finger then washed. Took the fogging right out."

Personal notes:

This can be printed without supports, but the bed adhesion is poor due to a small footprint. Highly recommended to print with a raft if not using supports.
