# Summary

Let's go on another search and rescue mission. To support this task, I present SAR that is optimally prepared for it. It swims very well and has a small dinghy for direct support which can be quickly lowered into the water. 

So that there is also something to rescue directly, it is recommended to print out the life raft as well. Thus the fun of playing can begin. 


Even if my boats are not benchmarks (benchy), you can use them for quality control.

<h3>Support me :)</h3>
<p>
Although it is a lot of fun to draw boats and bring them to life, it takes a lot of time to research and draw. Especially the 1:1000 scale models are very time-consuming.
So I wanted to see if there are any dear enthusiasts among you who appreciate my work and support me a little bit. 
Thank you for your help :)

Notes: 
To ensure that the boat floats optimally, it is recommended to print the red keel with 40% infill. The rest should then be printed with 15% infill.
